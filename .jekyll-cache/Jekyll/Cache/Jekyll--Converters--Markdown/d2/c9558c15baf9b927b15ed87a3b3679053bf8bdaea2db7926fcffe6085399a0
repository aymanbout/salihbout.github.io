<p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays an important role in real life applications primarily dealing with human-centric problems like healthcare and eldercare. It has seen a tremendous growth in the last decade playing a major role in the field of pervasive computing. 
In the recent years, lot of data mining techniques has evolved in analyzing the huge amount of data related to human activity, more specifically, machine learning methods have been been previously employed for recognition include Naive Bayes, SVMs, Threshold-based, Markov chains and deep learning models. Indeed, One important part of the prediction is the selection of suitable models, but also a good selection of relevant features would be benificial in the process of building an accurate model.</p>
