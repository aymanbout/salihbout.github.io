I"F<p>Music genre classification has been an interesting problem in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). In this tutorial, We will try to classify music genre using hidden Markov models which are very good at modeling time series data. As Music audio files are time series signals, we expect that HMMs will suit our needs and give us an accurate classification. An HMM is a model that represents probability distributions over sequences of observations. We assume that the outputs are generated by hidden states.

Also, you can find a good explanation for HHMs in the time series use case <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/hidden-markov-models-for-time-series-classification-basic-overview-a59b74e5e65b">here</a>.</p>
