I"¬<p>Bayesian Optimization is a useful tool for optimizing an objective function thus helping tuning machine learning models and simulations. Instead of using standard approaches like random search or grid search which are usually expensive or slow to do and where the objective function is a black box (we can not analytically express f or know its derivative), Bayesian Optimization comes in hand to  efficiently trades of between exploration and exploitation to find a global optimum is a minimum of number of steps.
It mainly rely on the idea of Bayes theorem , posterior = likelihood * prior, to quantify the beliefs about an unknown objective function given samples from the domain \(D\) and their evaluation via the objective function \(f\). Bayesian optimization incorporates prior belief about \(f\) and updates the prior with samples drawn from f to get a posterior that better approximates \(f\). (\(P(f|D) = P(D|f) * P(f)\)).</p>
